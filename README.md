# AI Job Application Assistant Using n8n & Mistral-3B

## Overview
This project implements an automated job-application assistant using **n8n**, **Mistral-3 3B**, and the **GitHub API**.  
The system searches for job postings on LinkedIn, customizes a user-provided cover-letter template for each job, generates tailored demo projects to showcase the applicant’s skills, uploads these projects to GitHub, and emails the final cover letters to the user.

## Usage

1. **Provide your base cover-letter template**  
   Place your general-purpose cover letter inside the `templates/` directory and reference it inside the “Rewrite Cover Letter” node in n8n.

2. **Run the workflow manually or schedule it**  
   Use n8n’s Cron node to execute the pipeline daily or weekly.

3. **Automated pipeline steps**  
   Once triggered, the workflow will:
   - Fetch job postings from LinkedIn or your scraper API  
   - Extract the job title, company name, and job details  
   - Generate a personalized cover letter using Mistral-3 3B  
   - Create a tailored demo project related to the role  
   - Upload the generated project files to your GitHub repository  
   - Convert the cover letter into a `.txt` file  
   - Email the final cover letter and GitHub link to the user  

4. **Review your results**
   - **Inbox:** Each job produces a personalized `.txt` cover letter  
   - **GitHub:** A new demo project is automatically uploaded for every job

## Results

The system automatically produces the following for each job posting:

- A **uniquely tailored cover letter**  
- A **job-specific demo project** showcasing relevant skills  
- An **uploaded GitHub repository** for each generated project  
- An **emailed `.txt` file** containing the finalized cover letter  

These outputs significantly strengthen job applications by increasing personalization and demonstrating hands-on ability.
